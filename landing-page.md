# Landing Page Spec
# Portfolio Review AI — Marketing / Conversion Page
# All components reference the design system in CLAUDE.md

---

## Purpose
Convert visiting designers into users. Single-page, scroll-driven layout. No auth required to start — the CTA leads directly to the upload flow.

---

## Dependencies
- `three` (Three.js) — WebGL renderer
- `@react-three/fiber` — React bindings for Three.js
- `@react-three/drei` — helpers (optional, only if needed for shaders)

---

## Page structure (top → bottom)

### 1. Navigation Bar
- Fixed top, `bg-surface-base/90 backdrop-blur-md border-b border-border z-30`
- Left: Logo mark + "Portfolio Review" — `font-display font-bold text-sm tracking-tight`
- Right: `Button ghost` "How It Works" (anchor scroll) + `Button primary` "Get Your Review"
- Mobile: hamburger icon (Lucide Menu), opens Drawer from right

### 2. Hero (with WebGL background)
- Full viewport height: `min-h-screen flex items-center relative`
- **WebGL canvas** sits behind all hero content (see WebGL section below)
- Eyebrow: `AI PORTFOLIO REVIEW`
- Heading (TextReveal): `font-display font-black text-6xl md:text-8xl tracking-tightest`
  - Line 1: "Your portfolio,"
  - Line 2: "reviewed by AI."
- Subheading (TextReveal delay 0.15): `text-lg md:text-xl text-ink-secondary max-w-content`
  - "Upload your design portfolio and get structured, actionable feedback on layout, hierarchy, storytelling, and presentation — in seconds."
- CTA row (TextReveal delay 0.3):
  - `MagneticButton` → `Button primary` "Get Your Review"
  - `Button ghost` "See how it works"
- No image in hero — editorial, text-first. The WebGL noise is the visual interest.

### 3. Trust Strip
- `py-8 border-y border-border`
- Row of 4–6 muted logos or text: "Trusted by designers from" + company names
- `text-xs text-ink-muted tracking-widest uppercase`
- Logos: `opacity-40 grayscale` (keep minimal, don't distract)

### 4. How It Works
- `Section` with eyebrow "HOW IT WORKS" + heading "Four steps to a stronger portfolio."
- 2×2 grid of `Card interactive`:
  - **Upload** — Lucide Upload icon, title, description
  - **Analyze** — Lucide Sparkles icon, title, description
  - **Score** — Lucide BarChart3 icon, title, description
  - **Improve** — Lucide MessageSquare icon, title, description
- Each card uses `useReveal` with staggered delays (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
- Icons: `w-5 h-5 text-acid mb-4`

### 5. Sample Review Preview

- Left: "Portfolio Review Tool — Built for designers." `text-xs text-ink-muted`
- Right: Year + links (Privacy, Terms) `text-xs text-ink-muted`

## WebGL — Hero Noise Distortion

### Concept
A full-screen fragment shader behind the hero that creates a living, breathing noise field. Think: dark liquid surface with subtle ridges of acid and mist color peeking through. Reacts to mouse position and fades out as the user scrolls past the hero.

### Technical spec

**Component:** `HeroCanvas`
- `"use client"` — client component
- Uses `@react-three/fiber` `<Canvas>` with a fullscreen quad (plane geometry filling the viewport)
- Canvas is `absolute inset-0 z-0` behind hero content (hero text is `relative z-10`)
- `pointer-events-none` on the canvas — don't block text interaction

**Shader: `heroNoise.glsl`**
- Fragment shader on a `ShaderMaterial` applied to a fullscreen plane
- Uniforms:
  - `uTime` (float) — elapsed time, drives noise evolution
  - `uMouse` (vec2) — normalized mouse position (0–1), creates local distortion around cursor
  - `uResolution` (vec2) — viewport dimensions
  - `uScrollProgress` (float) — 0 at top, 1 when hero is fully scrolled past → controls fade-out
  - `uColorAcid` (vec3) — acid #C8FF00 as RGB
  - `uColorMist` (vec3) — mist #A78BFA as RGB
  - `uColorBase` (vec3) — surface-base #0E0E0E as RGB

**Visual behavior:**
- Base: dark noise field matching `surface-base` — barely visible at rest
- Noise type: layered simplex noise (2–3 octaves), slow drift (`uTime * 0.15`)
- Color mapping: noise value drives mix between base → acid (peaks) and base → mist (valleys)
  - Most of the canvas stays near base color (dark) — only ridges/peaks show color
  - Acid appears on high noise values (bright ridges)
  - Mist appears on mid-range values (subtle fills between ridges)
  - Overall intensity is LOW — `mix(base, color, noiseValue * 0.15)` — this is background, not a light show
- Mouse interaction:
  - Within ~200px radius of cursor: noise amplitude increases slightly, creating a gentle ripple/warp
  - Effect: `noiseValue += smoothstep(200.0, 0.0, dist) * 0.1`
  - Smooth GSAP lerp on mouse position (don't track raw — ease toward target)
- Scroll fade-out:
  - As `uScrollProgress` goes 0→1, multiply final color opacity by `1.0 - uScrollProgress`
  - Canvas becomes invisible by the time hero is scrolled away
  - Use GSAP ScrollTrigger to feed scroll progress to the uniform

**Performance:**
- Render at 0.75x DPR (`dpr={[1, 1.5]}` on Canvas) — noise doesn't need retina precision
- Use `frameloop="always"` but consider `frameloop="demand"` + invalidate on mouse/scroll only if perf is a concern
- No post-processing passes — single shader, single draw call
- Mobile: reduce to 0.5x DPR, simplify to 1 octave of noise
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: if enabled, freeze noise at a static frame (set uTime to a constant, disable mouse reactivity)

**Fade-in on load:**
- Canvas starts at `opacity: 0`
- After hero TextReveal completes (~0.8s), GSAP fades canvas to `opacity: 1` over 1.2s
- This prevents the shader from appearing before the text, keeping the editorial reveal sequence clean

### File structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   └── HeroCanvas.tsx      # React component wrapping Canvas + shader
├── shaders/
│   ├── heroNoise.vert      # Simple passthrough vertex shader
│   └── heroNoise.frag      # Noise distortion fragment shader
└── lib/
    └── noise.glsl          # Reusable simplex noise function (imported in frag)
```

### Integration with hero
```tsx
<section className="min-h-screen flex items-center relative">
  {/* WebGL background */}
  <HeroCanvas />

  {/* Content on top */}
  <div className="relative z-10 max-w-full px-6 md:px-10 lg:px-16">
    <div className="max-w-wide mx-auto">
      {/* eyebrow, heading, subheading, CTAs */}
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

### Design rules for WebGL
- WebGL is NEVER the focal point — it's atmospheric background only
- Colors MUST come from the design system tokens (acid, mist, surface-base)
- Intensity stays LOW — if you can't read the text comfortably, it's too bright
- No additional colors, no rainbow effects, no heavy glow
- Mouse effect is subtle — enhance, don't distract
- Scroll fade-out is mandatory — WebGL lives in the hero only
- Falls back gracefully: if WebGL not supported, hero renders as plain `bg-surface-base` (no broken state)
